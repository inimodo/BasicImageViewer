# Basic Image Viewer
This is just a small project for my portfolio, to display my camera pictures. Its a React.js app that displays my images in a more interesting way than just plain HTML would. Nothing special but better than nothing. It does some parallaxing and some bluring and thats it. Have fun with it :)

## Usage
For usage drop your images into the ```images``` folder and then edit the entries in ```images.js```. Run ``` npm run build ``` and copy the files onto your server.

*Note: You might want to remove the field ```"homepage": "/images",```  from ```package.json```, otherwise it will only work if you put the files into a subdirectory named ``` images ```.*
